## Welcome!

First and foremost, Welcome! 🎉 Willkommen! 🎊 Bienvenue! 🙏 सुस्वागत (Suswagat)🎈🎈🎈

This document (the `README` file) is a hub to give you some information about the
project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find
out more.

## What are we doing?

We are working to create a mentoring program for individuals interested in becoming
ambassadors for Open Science practice, training and education in their communities.

Our outcome is to support early stage researchers and young leaders by sharing
Open Science skills, connecting them to others in the community,
and empowering them to become ambassadors for Open Science practice,
training and education in their communities.

## Who are we?

We are currently a team of 3 members who share a passion for Open Research and inclusiveness in Open Science.

As the graduates, mentors, and hosts of various Mozilla Open Leaders cohorts, we have gained expertise in the technical and culture track. Furthermore, we participate in a wide range of activities in different international communities of practice in the life sciences: ELIXIR (European bioinformatics network), Galaxy, The Carpentries, Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), and Mozilla.

## What do we need?

**You!** In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in open-science, training, mentoring, communication. We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course.

## Get involved

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can)
or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're sure
you can) then please check out [our contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and our [roadmap](roadmap.md).

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and
supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us
we ask that you follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all
interactions both on and offline.

## How can I generate the website locally?

You need a `ruby` environment (version >= 2.4). Either you have it installed and
you know how to install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and then run Jekyll, or you use
(mini-)[conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html), a package management system
that can install all these tools for you. You can install it by following the
instructions on this page: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

In the sequel, we assume you use miniconda.

2. Clone this GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the `open-life-science.github.io/` folder with `cd`
4. Install conda:

   ```
   make install-conda
   ```

4. Set up the conda environment:

   ```
   make create-env
   ```

## Create a new blog post

To create a new blog post:

    layout: post
    title: <title of the post>
    author: <github id of the author>

    ---
    ```

4. Add content of the post in the file in Markdown
3. Add images in `images/posts/`
